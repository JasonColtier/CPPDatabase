# Constructors

A constructor is a special member function that is automatically called after a non-aggregate class type object is created.

> the constructor doesnt allocate memory for the class (the compiler does), it only serves for initialisation


# Destructors

Destructors in C++ are special member functions of a class that are executed when an object of that class goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. They are used to release resources that the object may have acquired during its lifetime.
