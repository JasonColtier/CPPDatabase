Object slicing occurs when an object Derived, is assigned to an object of Base type.

The derived portion is sliced of because it is not part of the base class.

Any members inherited and set in the derived object will retain their values.

> There is no polymorphism here because we dont use pointer !

(object slicing can occure when playing with structs and inheritance in unreal)
