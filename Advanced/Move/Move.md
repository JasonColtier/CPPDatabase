# Course on C++ Move Semantics
**Introduction to Move Semantics**

Move semantics is a feature introduced in C++11 that allows resources to be transferred from one object to another, rather than being copied. This can result in significant performance improvements, especially for objects that manage dynamic memory or other resources.

    Lvalue: An object that occupies some identifiable location in memory (e.g., a variable name).
    Rvalue: A temporary object that does not occupy any identifiable location in memory.

**Move Constructor and Move Assignment Operator**

The move constructor and move assignment operator enable an object to take ownership of the resources of another object.
